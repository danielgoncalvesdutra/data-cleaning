# data-cleaning

Hi!

In this repository you'll find two folders for each,

"Sold-Units" is the simpler data cleaning.

"Boba-Tea-Shop" is a little more complex data cleaning.

This data cleanings were done by me while studying to get my Google Data Analyst certificate.

I followed this informations provided by the course to progress:

What is dirty data?

-Duplicate data: Any data record that shows up more than once.

-Outdated data: Any data that is old which should be replaced with newer and more accurate information.

-Incomplete data: Any data that is missing important fields.

-Incorrect/inaccurate data: Any data that is complete but inaccurate.

-Inconsistent data: Any data that uses different formats to represent the same thing.

And to clean the data I followed some tips from this sources:
