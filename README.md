# data-cleaning

Hi!

This data cleaning project was done by me while studying to get my Google Data Analyst certificate.

I followed this informations provided by the course to accomplish the project:

What is dirty data?

-Duplicate data: Any data record that shows up more than once

-Outdated data: Any data that is old which should be replaced with newer and more accurate information

-Incomplete data: Any data that is missing important fields

-Incorrect/inaccurate data: Any data that is complete but inaccurate

-Inconsistent data: Any data that uses different formats to represent the same thing


In this repository you'll find two files, the dirty data and the data after being clean.
